# Minimal

Minimal is a simple, extensible [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)-based
minimalist [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog theme.

## Usage

To use this theme, you can fork this repository and replace the configs and
contents with your own.

Additionally, you can declare this theme as a gem in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "minimal", git: "https://github.com/ZhongRuoyu/jekyll-minimal.git"
```

Then, add the following to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: minimal
```

If you use the gem-based approach, make sure to override the configs found in
[`_config.yml`](https://github.com/ZhongRuoyu/jekyll-minimal/blob/HEAD/_config.yml).
